# Quarknet-1

*BSc 2nd Year*


I used **Quarknet** site to access Fermilab Test Array data. 
- In part 1, I did a flux study of a one-day muon dataset. In part 2, I did a flux study of a one-week dataset. Additionally, I compared the flux rate with pressure and the flux rate with temperature to try to find any correlation between them. By comparing the plot of Flux vs. Time and the plot of Pressure vs. Time for the same time ranges, I noticed that flux and pressure show an inverse relationship. This relationship can also be seen in the correlogram I made using the one-week dataset in Python. However, I did not find any specific relationship between the plot of Flux vs. Time and the plot of Temperature vs. Time.
